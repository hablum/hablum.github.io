# Languages I've learned

Turing (ICS2O) - The first language I learned in Computer Science was Turing and it really helped me understand how programming and coding works because of how simple to use it is.
Actionscript (ICS2O) - When we finished Turing we began learning how to code in Actionscript 3.0. It's the language we used for our summative game and it's much more different compared to other languages we learned.
C++ (ICS3U) - We learned how to code in C++ in ICS3U last year. I prefer this language to the ones we learned in ICS2O because of how it has more depth and features compared to Turing and is much more easier to understand and code in compared to Actionscript 3.0
