# Activities and Modules completed
[Here are my Khan Academy projects](https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/hassibk/projects "My projects!")


## 1. Intro to Javascript

I finished Intro to Javascript on Khan Academy which was my first time using this language. A wide variety of code such as objects, arrays, loops and more are used in the projects and assignments. A good example of that is Project: Fish tank which has you define the properties of a fish and place it with like an object.

## 2. Intro to HTML/CSS

I also finished intro to HTML/CSS on Khan Academy. My favourite part of this was learning how to style and colour everything with HTML. One of my projects, Travel Webpage has you colour text and insert images which is very important to using HTML and is also a good example of the things you learn.

## 3. Natural Simulations

I found Natural Simulations to be more difficult compared to the other 2 modules on Khan Academy because of all the newly introduced functions and things in JS. They were a bit overwhelming because of their complexity but I still finished it. Number distribution is used to randomly place things which I found cool so I picked Project: Paint splatter for randomly picking the location and colour palettes.

## 4. Coding Challenge

Our summative in ICS4U was replicating a coding challenge by Dan Shiffman and my team chose Asteroids. We settled on Asteroids because we thought it looked cool and liked the physics used by accelerating the ship and laser to destroy the asteroids by splitting them into smaller pieces.

## 5. Arduino Nano board

I also learned about Arduino boards, the Nano ones in particular. My team would work on this once a week for a while and we'd use the Arduino online editor to change the way things on the board worked. We were able to use a button to turn a light attached to the board on and make it work the other way around.

## 6. Making Webpages Interactive

I began but didn't finish the Making Webpages Interactive module on Khan Academy. I didn't finish it but I really liked the idea of making webpages interactive through code and creating things that provide an interactive experience. 

## 7. Git-it workflow

I completed the tutorial on Git-It which taught some things about branching, merging pull requests and other things. This was important for my workflow because it showed me ways to efficiently get things done.

# Languages I've learned

1. Turing (ICS2O) - The first language I learned in Computer Science was Turing and it really helped me understand how programming and coding works because of how simple to use it is.
2. Actionscript (ICS2O) - When we finished Turing we began learning how to code in Actionscript 3.0. It's the language we used for our summative game and it's much more different compared to other languages we learned.
3. C++ (ICS3U) - We learned how to code in C++ in ICS3U last year. I prefer this language to the ones we learned in ICS2O because of how it has more depth and features compared to Turing and is much more easier to understand and code in compared to Actionscript 3.0
4. Javascript (ICS4U) - We learned how to program in JS this year in ICS4U. This language lets you create pictures and make things move with code but was harder for me to understand at first.
5. HTML/CSS (ICS4U) - We learned this language this year as well. I found it interesting to learn that this is how websites are created and the syntax of HTML and CSS.
6. Markdown (ICS4U) - We learned how to program in this language for some websites we made this year. I prefer this over HTML for the simplicity and in fact, this website you're reading was written in Markdown!

## Some repositories I contributed to

[ICS4U Summative Repo](https://github.com/OCSDB/ics4u-coding-challenge-lasagna-boy "ICS4U Asteroids Project")

# Learning experiences as a programmer

I learned alot of important things in ICS4U this year. Something very important is that you should always ask for help when you need it. That way, you'll learn how to solve your problem and can use that knowledge to help you in future projects. It's also important to make sure your code is clear and easy to understand with the way you format things. Finally, it helps if you go over instructions for challenges and other assignments slowly so that you don't miss any important details. This has happened to me several times because I read through the instructions too quickly

# Intentions for the future

* I want to continue to code in JS because I feel like I have lots of room with that language and with object-oriented programming in general.
* Continuing to work on my Github profile and uploading code I make and have made will also be beneficial. I think this way because all my code will be in one place to view. For example, if I'm applying for a job or for a school after high school then I can use my profile to display my code. I didn't like Github very much at first, but now it's become a very useful tool that I will use in the future.
* I want to pursue a degree in Computer Science for my post-secondary education and I'll do that by taking the necessary courses in high school.
* I want to learn more about making webpages interactive because I wasn't able to get through that module on Khan Academy.


# FreeCodeCamp portfolio 

For this aspect, I want to continue to improve my competency in Javascript and I think a great way of doing that would be to work on Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures. It has lots of things we did earlier on in JS which will help refresh my memory on things we haven't done in some time and somethings I need to practise. What's most important is some things that I haven't learned yet in JS that will open my eyes to some new things that I can do in JS.
